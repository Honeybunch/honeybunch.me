This is a personal game engine project that I use to explore rendering with the Vulkan API. It's built on top of SDL2 and a number of dependencies from [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

It's currently *unstable* and is really only capable of loading some simple test scenes. I've recently been refactoring a large chunk of the engine in the `world` branch. After that I'm hoping to tidy up some features before trying to use it to make something that resembles a game.

Check [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/HoneybunchBuilder/toybox) if you're interested in trying to build it and check it out on your own hardware.
